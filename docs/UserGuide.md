   npm --version
   ```
   ‚úÖ Both commands should return version numbers

#### Step 4: Install Dependencies
1. Open Command Prompt/Terminal as Administrator
2. Navigate to the frontend directory:
   ```bash
   cd C:\ST-Engineering\Dashboard\frontend
   ```
3. Install all dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install

   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
   ‚úÖ Should return Python 3.9 or higher

#### Step 4: Install Dependencies
1. Navigate to the webdashboard directory:
   ```bash
   cd /home/user/webdashboard
   ```

2. Install Flask dependencies:
   ```bash
   cd backend/dependencies/flask_pkgs
   pip3 install *.whl
   ```

3. Install pexpect dependencies:

### Verification

#### Test Frontend-Backend Connection
1. Open the dashboard at `http://localhost:3000`
2. In the sidebar, add a node using the IP address of your gNB board
3. Click "ADD" - the node should appear in the sidebar
4. ‚úÖ **Success**: Node status updates to show current state (RUNNING/INITIALIZING/OFF)
5. ‚ùå **Failure**: Node shows as "DISCONNECTED" - check network connectivity and backend service

#### Network Connectivity Checklist
- [ ] gNB board is powered on and connected to network
- [ ] Client machine can ping the gNB board IP address  
- [ ] Backend service is running on port 5000
- [ ] No firewall blocking port 5000

## ‚ùì FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: How frequently does the dashboard update node status?**
**A:** The dashboard updates node attributes every 1 second and node status every 3 seconds to provide real-time monitoring while minimizing network load.

**Q: What does each node status color indicate?**
**A:** 
- üü¢ **Green**: Node is RUNNING and fully operational
- üü° **Yellow**: Node is INITIALIZING (starting up)
- üî¥ **Red**: Node is OFF or powered down
- ‚ö´ **Black**: Node is DISCONNECTED (unreachable)

**Q: Can I add a node that's currently offline?**
**A:** Yes, you can add any node by IP address. If the node is unreachable, it will be added to the dashboard but shown as disconnected until it becomes available.

**Q: How many nodes can the dashboard support?**
**A:** The dashboard is designed to support 20 or more nodes simultaneously, though performance may vary based on your hardware resources.

### Installation & Setup

**Q: What browsers are supported?**
**A:** The dashboard works best with modern browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge (latest versions). Internet Explorer is not supported.

**Q: Do I need special permissions to install the dashboard?**
**A:** You may need administrator privileges to install Node.js and modify system settings. The dashboard itself can run with standard user permissions.

**Q: Can I run the dashboard on a different port?**
**A:** Yes, you can modify the port in the package.json file or use environment variables. The default ports are 3000 (frontend) and 5000 (backend).

### Operation & Usage

**Q: How do I troubleshoot a node that won't start?**
**A:** 
1. Navigate to the node's dashboard
2. Check the logs for error messages
3. Ensure the node is reachable on the network
4. Try restarting using "Turn Off" followed by "Turn On"
5. Contact support if issues persist

**Q: Is my node configuration saved if I close the browser?**
**A:** Yes, node configurations are stored in the browser's localStorage, so your configured nodes will persist when you reopen the dashboard in the same browser.

**Q: Can I access the dashboard remotely?**
**A:** Yes, if properly configured with appropriate network access and security measures. Ensure proper firewall and security settings are in place.

### Performance & Monitoring

**Q: Why are my performance charts not updating?**
**A:** Check that:
- The node is connected and responding
- Backend service is running
- Network connectivity is stable
- Browser is not blocking JavaScript execution

**Q: How much historical data is stored?**
**A:** The dashboard maintains approximately 200 data points for performance charts. Older data is automatically rotated to maintain performance.
